**Status**: All integrity checks passed

#### Database Statistics
| Table | Records | Unique Sessions | Date Range |
|-------|---------|-----------------|------------|
| errors | 4 | 4 | Sept 1, 2025 |
| session_events | 14 | 4 | Nov 2023 - Sept 2025 |
| network_events | 8 | 4 | Nov 2023 - Sept 2025 |
| sessions | 4 | 4 | Sept 1, 2025 |

#### Integrity Validations
- ✅ **Zero orphaned records** across all tables
- ✅ **No invalid timestamps** detected
- ✅ **Proper foreign key relationships** maintained
- ✅ **Session correlation** working correctly

## API Endpoint Testing

### Core Capture Endpoints ✅
```
POST /api/capture/error              ✅ Working
POST /api/capture/session-event      ✅ Working (batch + single)
POST /api/capture/network-event      ✅ Working
```

### Data Retrieval Endpoints ✅
```
GET  /api/errors/:projectId          ✅ Working (pagination support)
GET  /api/session/:sessionId/events  ✅ Working (unified timeline)
GET  /health                         ✅ Working
```

### Security Features ✅
- ✅ API key validation (401 for invalid/missing keys)
- ✅ Project-level data isolation
- ✅ Input sanitization and JSON parsing
- ✅ Error handling and logging

## Session Monitoring Capabilities

### Event Types Successfully Captured ✅
1. **User Interactions**: clicks, input changes, navigation
2. **Page Events**: pageview, scroll, resize
3. **Performance Metrics**: load times, web vitals, paint metrics
4. **Network Activity**: API calls, response times, status codes
5. **Error Events**: JavaScript errors, stack traces, metadata
6. **Batch Operations**: Multiple events in single request

### Session Timeline Features ✅
- **Chronological Ordering**: Events sorted by timestamp
- **Event Source Tracking**: Differentiates session, network, and error events

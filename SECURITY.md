### üìã Security Best Practices for Users

#### For Self-Hosted Deployments

- **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
- **Secure Configuration**: Follow our security configuration guide
- **Network Security**: Use firewalls and restrict access to necessary ports
- **Regular Backups**: Implement automated, encrypted backup solutions
- **Monitor Logs**: Set up log monitoring and alerting

#### For SDK Integration

- **API Key Security**: Store API keys securely, never in client-side code
- **Data Sanitization**: Sanitize sensitive data before sending to Revi
- **Privacy Settings**: Configure appropriate privacy controls for your users
- **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production environments

#### For Dashboard Access

- **Strong Passwords**: Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable 2FA for all user accounts
- **Session Management**: Configure appropriate session timeouts
- **Access Reviews**: Regularly review and revoke unnecessary access

### üö® Known Security Considerations

#### Data Handling

- **Session Recordings**: May contain sensitive user data - configure masking appropriately
- **Error Context**: Error reports may include sensitive application state
- **Network Requests**: API calls may contain sensitive request/response data

#### Self-Hosting Security

- **Database Access**: Secure your PostgreSQL and Redis instances
- **API Endpoints**: Properly secure all API endpoints with authentication
- **File Permissions**: Set appropriate file system permissions
- **Reverse Proxy**: Use a reverse proxy with proper security headers
